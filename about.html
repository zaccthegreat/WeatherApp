            <p>Welcome to my site, My name is Zacchaeus Day I'm a Senior IT Specialist. This page is meant to give you a brief rundown of my who I am. From an early age, I've been creative, from playing musical instruments to building legos to doing photography and drawing. It wasn't until I reached high school and the technology teacher introduced me to the world computers.</p>
            </p>It was a life-changing experience; I immediately gravitated to it. In my Junior and Senior year of high school, I took as many technology elective classes as possible to learn about web design and computer repair.</p>
            <p>I took my newly learned passion and taught myself everything I could get my hands on, even if I didn't entirely grasp it.</p>
            <p>As the years have gone by my passion for learning and using new technologies hasn't dwindled.</p>
